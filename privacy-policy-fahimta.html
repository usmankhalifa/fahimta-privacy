  <h1>Fahimta – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> October 01, 2025</p>
  <p>Fahimta (“the App”) is an educational mobile application that provides Hausa-language learning and voice features. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.</p>
  <p>If you do not agree with this Policy, please do not install or use the App.</p>

  <h2>1. Who we are &amp; how to contact us</h2>
  <p><strong>Controller:</strong> Fahimta App Team<br>
  <strong>Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:your-support-email@example.com">khalteknetworks@gmail.com</a><br>
  <strong>Postal address:</strong> </p>

  <h2>2. What data we collect</h2>
  <p>We strive to process the minimum data necessary for the App to work.</p>
  <h3>2.1 Account &amp; profile (if you sign in)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Name, email address, profile photo (if you choose to provide).</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.2 App usage &amp; diagnostics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>In‑app events (e.g., lesson started/completed), basic device information (model, OS version), crash logs, and performance metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> to improve reliability, measure feature usage, and fix bugs.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.3 Voice &amp; audio (only when you use voice features)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Microphone audio</strong> and <strong>transcriptions</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>On‑device vs cloud:</strong> Where possible, speech processing is done on the device. If you choose cloud‑based speech recognition, audio snippets may be sent securely to our speech provider solely to return text; we do not use audio to identify you.</li>
    <li><strong>Retention:</strong> We do not keep raw audio after processing. Transcripts may be stored locally on your device to show your history unless you clear them.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>2.4 Payments (if applicable)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>If you purchase content, payment processing is handled by <strong>Google Play</strong> and/or the selected payment provider. We do not receive your full card details.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Why we collect data (legal bases)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Provide the service:</strong> enable lessons, speech‑to‑text, text‑to‑speech.</li>
    <li><strong>Improve &amp; secure the App:</strong> diagnostics, analytics, and fraud prevention.</li>
    <li><strong>Comply with law &amp; enforce terms.</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Sharing your data</h2>
  <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your personal data. We share data only with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Service providers</strong> acting on our instructions (e.g., analytics, crash reporting, optional cloud STT/TTS).</li>
    <li><strong>Authorities</strong> when required by law or to protect users and our rights.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All providers must protect your data and may not use it for their own purposes.</p>
  <p><strong>Examples of processors (may vary by build):</strong><br>
  Google Play Services, Firebase Crashlytics/Analytics.<br>
  Optional speech services (e.g., cloud speech‑to‑text) when you enable cloud mode.</p>

  <h2>5. International transfers</h2>
  <p>If we transfer data across borders, we use reasonable safeguards (e.g., standard contractual clauses) where required.</p>

  <h2>6. Data retention</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Account/profile: retained while your account is active.</li>
    <li>Usage &amp; diagnostics: retained for a limited period needed for analysis and troubleshooting.</li>
    <li>Voice audio: not retained after processing; transcripts may remain on your device until you delete them.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When no longer needed, data is deleted or anonymized.</p>

  <h2>7. Your choices &amp; rights</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Permissions:</strong> You can revoke Microphone/Storage/Notifications in your device settings. The App may stop working for features that need those permissions.</li>
    <li><strong>Access &amp; deletion:</strong> You can request a copy or deletion of your personal data by emailing us.</li>
    <li><strong>Opt‑out of analytics:</strong> Use the in‑app settings (if available) or your device’s ad/analytics settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. Children’s privacy</h2>
  <p>The App is designed for general audiences and <strong>is not directed to children under 13</strong>. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If your app targets children or schools, obtain verifiable parental consent where required and provide a supervised experience. If we learn we’ve collected data from a child under 13 without consent, we will delete it.</p>

  <h2>9. Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organizational measures (encryption in transit, access controls, least‑privilege practices) to protect your data. No system is 100% secure.</p>

  <h2>10. Third‑party links</h2>
  <p>The App may link to external sites we don’t control. Their privacy practices are governed by their own policies.</p>

  <h2>11. Changes to this Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Policy periodically. We will post the updated version here and update the “Effective date”.</p>
